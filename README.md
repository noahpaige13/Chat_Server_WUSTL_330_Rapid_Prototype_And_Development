Creative Portion:

1. Timestamp: When a message is sent, the date and time of when the message was sent is also displayed in the chat log for all users to see.
2. Delete a room: We added the feature of deleting a room. In order to delete the room, the user must be the creator of that room. All users currently in that room are then moved back to the main lobby and the room is removed from the chat room list.
3. Broadcast messages: When a user joins or leaves a room, a broadcast message is sent to all other users that that user has entered/left the room they are in.
